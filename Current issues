CURRENT ISSUES 
---------------

- SHLVL needs to be incremented everytime we call minishell inside minishell (and go back to its previous value when closing one). Every minishell call inside minishell = a child, that becomes the parent of the next child, that becomes the parent of the next child, ...
- ctrl \ should be set to IGN if called in parent and DFL if called in child
- echo $pwd, maybe need another function to update the env
