CURRENT ISSUES 
---------------

1. signals can't update their exit codes

2. unset the first environment variable leads to segfault when trying to display the environment list (via env or export)

3. how to update the environment variables that change when using commands (pwd, shlvl, old pwd? other?)

4. redirections with echo doesn't behave as expected
