CURRENT ISSUES 
---------------

1. signals can't update their exit codes

2. unset the first environment variable leads to segfault when trying to display the environment list (via env or export)

3. how to update the environment variables that change when using commands (pwd, shlvl, old pwd? other?)

4. redirections with echo doesn't behave as expected


When running cat | cat | ls:

    First cat should have stdin as TTY (or /dev/pts/X) and stdout as a pipe.

    Second cat should have stdin from the previous pipe, and stdout to the next pipe.

    ls should have stdin from a pipe (optional), stdout = terminal.

If all pipes and FDs are wired up correctly and still it exits early, it’s likely that one of these happens:

    First cat receives EOF and exits.

    A writer FD is closed too early by the parent.

    ls finishes and remaining processes don’t have input to consume.
