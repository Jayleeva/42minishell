CURRENT ISSUES 
---------------

- needed to change the cmd->outfile and cmd->infile for echo, but this seems to break execve cmd.

- I don't know how to kill a child process for ctrl \.

- unset the first environment variable leads to segfault when trying to display the environment list (via env or export)

- how to update the environment variables that change when using commands (pwd, shlvl, old pwd? other?)
