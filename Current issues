CURRENT ISSUES 
---------------

- SHLVL needs to be incremented everytime we call minishell inside minishell, and decremented everytime we close one. Every minishell call inside minishell = a child, that becomes the parent of the next child, that becomes the parent of the next child, ...
- export doesnt handle mutliple args, only exports the first oneclear
- echo $pwd, maybe need another function to update the env 

- exit agv, for exp  exit 5
  exit
  $? (returns the last exit of the cmd)
  0: command not found  //should prit 5, which is that last exit
- env -i ./minishell
