CURRENT ISSUES 
---------------

- needed to change the cmd->outfile and cmd->infile for echo, but this seems to break execve cmd...

- ctrl \ needs to be ignored if not in a blocking command (child)


When running cat | cat | ls:

    First cat should have stdin as TTY (or /dev/pts/X) and stdout as a pipe.

    Second cat should have stdin from the previous pipe, and stdout to the next pipe.

    ls should have stdin from a pipe (optional), stdout = terminal.

If all pipes and FDs are wired up correctly and still it exits early, it’s likely that one of these happens:

    First cat receives EOF and exits.

    A writer FD is closed too early by the parent.

    ls finishes and remaining processes don’t have input to consume.
